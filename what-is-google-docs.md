 ## What is Google Docs
 **Google Docs** is a web-based word processing application that is part of the **Google Workspace suite**, designed for businesses, schools, and individuals. It provides a simple and accessible way to create, edit, and share documents in real time using a web browser or the mobile application. 
 Google Docs works entirely online-no installation is required. You can create, edit, update, import, and export files using various formats, such as `.docx` and `.pdf`. You collaborate with multiple people on the same document, and everyone's changes appear instantly. Your work is saved automatically as you type.
